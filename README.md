> Loco-JS-Core provides a logical structure for JavaScript code

# üßê What is Loco-JS-Core?

Loco-JS-Core is a part of the Loco framework. It has been extracted from [Loco-JS](https://github.com/locoframework/loco-js) and can be used separately. Loco-JS-Core provides a logical structure for JavaScript code. This functionality was the origin of the Loco project. That's why it received a suffix **Core**. 

Model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller (usually known as MVC) frameworks like [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) are trendy on the back-end. The controller's action responds to the user input and converts it to commands for the model or view.  
I wanted to be sure that _"the same"_ controller's action that handles a request on the back-end is also called on the front-end side. By "the same" - I mean action with the same name and defined in an (optionally namespaced) controller with the name corresponding to the one on the server-side. 

The preceding clarification is only for the sake of understanding the connection between the front-end and back-end parts of the Loco framework. Both parts are loosely coupled in fact when it comes to this functionality. To pass controller related information to the front-end, the back-end part uses data attributes of the `<body>` HTML element. These attributes can be modified in various ways. This is why Loco-JS-Core can be used as a standalone library without a specific back-end companion.

*Visualization of the Loco framework:*

|--- Loco-Rails (back-end part)
|       |
|       |--- Loco-Rails-Core (logical structure for JS / can be used separately with Loco-JS-Core)
|
|--- Loco-JS (front-end part)
        |
        |--- Loco-JS-Core (logical structure for JS / can be used separately)
        |
        |--- Loco-JS-Model (model part / can be used separately)
        |
        |--- other built-in parts of Loco-JS

# üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How does it work?

After document is loaded, Loco-JS' instance checks following `<body>`'s data attributes:

* data-namespace
* data-controller
* data-action

Then, based on their values, it initializes given controllers and calls given methods. Example:

```html
<body data-namespace="Main" data-controller="Pages" data-action="index">
</body>
```

Loco-JS will act like this (simplified version):

```javascript
import { init, Controllers } from "loco-js-core";

namespaceController = new Controllers.Main;
namespaceController.initialize();

controller = new Controllers.Main.Pages;
controller.initialize();
controller.index();
```

What's important is that Loco-JS looks not only for instance methods but static ones as well. If some controller is not defined, Loco-JS skips it. The same situation is with methods. You don't have to create controllers for every page that you have too. You can use Loco-JS only on desired ones. It does not want to take over your front-end. Augment with JavaScript only those pages that you want instead.

If namespace controller is not defined, Loco-JS will assume `Controllers.Pages` as a controller.

If you use Loco-JS along with Loco-Rails - after calling specified methods, Loco-JS will try to establish WebSocket connection with the server and will be waiting for signals / notifications.
If WebSocket connection can't be established, Loco-JS will start periodically checking for new notifications via AJAX polling.

# üî© Merging classes

As you can see in the previous section, Loco-JS must have an access to all defined controllers to initialize them and to call given methods on them. Therefore, they have to be merged with `Controllers` object which Loco-JS exports.

```javascript
// javascripts/index.js (entry point)

import { Controllers } from "loco-js";

import Admin from "./controllers/admin"; // namespace controller
import User from "./controllers/user";   // namespace controller

Object.assign(Controllers, {
  Admin,
  User
});
```

```javascript
// javascripts/controllers/admin.js (namespace controller)

import { Controllers } from "loco-js";

import Coupons from "./admin/coupons"; // Coupons controller
import Plans from "./admin/plans";     // Plans controller

class Admin extends Controllers.Base {}

Object.assign(Admin, {
  Coupons,
  Plans
});

export default Admin;
```

You don't have to define namespace controllers. You can merge controllers directly with exported `Controllers` object.

Remember to polyfill `Object.assign` or assign controllers using a different method.

# 🧐 What is Simplicit?

Simplicit is a small library for structuring front-end JavaScript around **controllers** and **components**.

On the MVC side, it mirrors the “controller/action” convention you may know from frameworks like [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org): based on `<body>` attributes, it finds the corresponding controller and calls its lifecycle hooks and action method.

On the component side, it provides a lightweight runtime (`start()` + `Component`) that instantiates and binds components from `data-component`, builds parent/child relationships, and automatically tears them down when elements are removed from the DOM.

# 🤝 Dependencies

Simplicit relies only on `dompurify` for sanitizing HTML.

# 📲 Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save simplicit
```

# 🎮 Usage

## 🖲️ Components

Simplicit ships with a small component runtime built around DOM attributes.

### ✅ Quick start

```javascript
import { start, Component } from "simplicit";

class Hello extends Component {
  static name = "hello";

  connect() {
    const { input, button, output } = this.refs();
    this.on(button, "click", () => {
      output.textContent = `Hello ${input.value}!`;
    });
  }
}

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  start({ root: document, components: [Hello] });
});
```

```html
<div data-component="hello">
  <input data-ref="input" type="text" />
  <button data-ref="button">Greet</button>
  <span data-ref="output"></span>
</div>
```

### DOM conventions

* **`data-component="<name>"`**: marks an element as a component root.
  * `<name>` must match the component class’ **`static name`**.
  * `<script>` tags are never treated as components, even if they have `data-component`.
* **`data-component-id="<id>"`**: set automatically on every element with `data-component` (each component instance).
  * Also available as `instance.componentId`.
* **`data-ref="<key>"`**: marks ref elements inside a component (see `ref()` / `refs()`).

### `start({ root, components })`

`start()` scans `root` (defaults to `document.body`) for elements with `data-component`, creates and binds component instances for them, and keeps them in sync with DOM changes (new elements get initialized, removed ones get disconnected).

* **Validation**
  * Throws if the DOM contains `data-component="X"` but you didn’t pass a matching class in `components`.
  * Throws if any provided component class does not define a writable `static name`.
* **Lifecycle**
  * When an instance is created, if it has `connect()`, it is called after the instance is bound to its root DOM element (available as `this.element`).
  * When a component element is removed from the DOM, its `instance.disconnect()` is called automatically.

#### Return value

`start()` returns an object:

* **`roots`**: array of root component instances (components whose parent is `null`) discovered at startup.
* **`addComponents(newComponents)`**: registers additional component classes later.
  * Validates the DOM again.
  * Scans the existing DOM for elements with `data-component` matching the newly added classes and initializes those that weren’t initialized yet.
  * Returns the newly created instances (or `null` if nothing was added).
* **`addModels(newModels)`**: registers additional `Model` classes later (the model counterpart of `addComponents`).
  * Links each Model’s representation components to it and registers them (you don’t pass them in `addComponents` yourself).
  * Hydrates any `data-model` script already on the page for the newly added Models and renders their containers; the Models stay subscribed so later markup resolves too.
  * Returns the newly created component instances (or `null` if nothing was added).

### Base class: `Component`

Simplicit exports a `Component` base class you can extend.

#### Core properties

* **`element`**: the root DOM element of the component (`data-component="..."`).
* **`node`**: internal node graph `{ name, element, parent, children, siblings }`.
* **`componentId`**: string id mirrored to `data-component-id`.
* **`parent`**: parent component instance (or `null` for root components).
* **`props`**: the data the component was rendered with (see [templates](#server-driven-templates-via-script-typeapplicationjson) / `Component.render`), available before `connect()`. Defaults to `{}` for components mounted from plain markup. Treat `props` as the full state that drives the markup.

#### Reactive updates

* **`update(partial)`**: merges `partial` into `this.props`, re-renders `static template(this.props)`, and **morphs** the result into the live DOM — patching only changed text/attributes/nodes instead of replacing the subtree. Returns `this`.

  Because morphing keeps node identity, anything tied to an unchanged node survives the update: focus, text selection, and scroll position.

  This makes the template a pure function of `props`: write a single decision tree over all props that affect the markup, then call `update()` to move between states instead of mutating the DOM by hand.

#### Keying list items with `data-key`

Morphing compares the old and new children **by position**: child 1 against child 1, child 2 against child 2, and so on. Same tag at a position → the existing node is patched in place; different tag → it’s replaced. That’s exactly right for fixed layouts, but it’s the wrong default for a **list whose items reorder, get inserted, or get removed**.

Say you render a list and then delete the first item. Positionally, every item shifts up one slot, so the morph patches each surviving node into the *next* item’s data — every row is mutated, and whatever was tied to those nodes (focus, a half-typed input, a CSS transition) is now attached to the wrong row.

Add **`data-key="<stable-id>"`** to each item so morphing can recognise identity instead of trusting position:

```javascript
static template = ({ todos }) => `
  <ul data-component="todos">
    ${todos.map((t) => `<li data-key="${t.id}">${t.label}</li>`).join("")}
  </ul>
`;
```

With keys, two nodes are only treated as “the same” when their tag **and** `data-key` match; a position whose key changed is replaced rather than mutated, so a node’s identity follows its data, not its slot. Recommended whenever you render a collection from an array — use a stable id from your data (a database id, a uuid), never the array index, since the index is just the position you’re trying to stop relying on.

> Note: keys here are a correctness guard for the positional diff (replace-vs-patch), not full move-detection — the morph doesn’t relocate a moved node, it rebuilds it where the key no longer matches. That keeps identity attached to the right data; it just doesn’t physically reuse a node that jumped position.

#### Listeners

Bind events to your component's elements **by ref name**, declared once in `connect()`:

```javascript
class Counter extends Component {
  static name = "counter";

  static template = ({ count }) =>
    `<div data-component="counter"><button data-ref="inc">${count}</button></div>`;

  connect() {
    this.on("inc", "click", () => this.update({ count: this.props.count + 1 }));
    this.update({ count: 0 }); // paint the initial template into the empty <div data-component="counter">
  }
}
```

A component mounted from plain markup keeps whatever HTML is already inside its element — `template` does **not** run automatically. To render it client-side, call `update(initialProps)` in `connect()` (as above); it morphs the template in, and `on("<ref>", ...)` then attaches to the freshly painted refs.

**`on(target, type, listener, options?)`** — `target` can be a **ref name** (`"inc"`) or a **ref element** (`this.ref("inc")`); both behave identically, because an element carries its own `data-ref`. The framework keeps `listener` attached to whatever `[data-ref]` elements match after **every** render: it binds nodes that morphing recreated, binds refs that only appear in a later state, unbinds ones that disappear, and de-duplicates so kept nodes never stack handlers. Declare it once in `connect()` and never think about it again.

The one difference is for targets that **have no `data-ref`** — `window`, `document`, or the component root (`this.element`). Those can't be addressed by ref, so the listener is simply pinned to that exact object (and, since those never get morphed away, that's all you need).

Prefer the ref name for not-yet-rendered elements: `this.ref("inc")` returns `null` before its first render, so only `on("inc", ...)` can bind a ref that appears later.

Both return an `off()` and are cleared automatically on `disconnect()`. For an imperative touch-up after a state change (focus an input, scroll into view), do it right after `update()` — the morph is synchronous, so the new ref is already in the DOM:

```javascript
edit() {
  this.update({ editing: true });
  this.ref("input").focus(); // input exists now
}
```

#### Relationships

All relationship helpers filter by component name(s):

* **`children(nameOrNames)`**: direct children component instances (DOM order).
* **`siblings(nameOrNames)`**: sibling component instances.
* **`ancestor(name)`**: nearest matching ancestor component instance (or `null`).
* **`descendants(name)`**: all matching descendants (flat array).

#### Refs

Refs are scoped to the component’s root element.

* **`ref(name)`**: returns `null`, a single element, or an array of elements (when multiple match).
* **`refs()`**: returns an object mapping each `data-ref` key to `Element | Element[]`. Only elements inside the component that have `data-ref` are included.

#### Cleanup & lifecycle utilities

`disconnect()` runs cleanup callbacks once and detaches the instance from its parent/child links.

You can register cleanup manually or use helpers that auto-register cleanup:

* **`registerCleanup(fn)`**
* **`on(target, type, listener, options)`** (auto-removes the listener on disconnect)
* **`timeout(fn, delay)`** (auto-clears on disconnect)
* **`interval(fn, delay)`** (auto-clears on disconnect)

### Server-driven templates via `<script type="application/json">`

If a component class defines `static template(props)`, Simplicit can render HTML from JSON embedded in the page.

```javascript
import { start, Component } from "simplicit";

class Slide extends Component {
  static name = "slide";
  static template = ({ text }) => `<div data-component="slide">${text}</div>`;
}

start({ root: document, components: [Slide] });
```

```html
<div id="slideshow"></div>

<script
  type="application/json"
  data-component="slide"
  data-target="slideshow"
  data-position="beforeend"
>
  [{"text":"A"},{"text":"B"}]
</script>
```

Or drop `data-target`/`data-position` to render in place, where the script sits:

```html
<div id="slideshow">
  <script type="application/json" data-component="slide">
    [{"text":"A"},{"text":"B"}]
  </script>
</div>
```

Notes:

* The JSON payload must be an **array**; each item is passed as `props` to `ComponentClass.template(props)`.
* Each item is also attached to its rendered root element and exposed on the instance as **`this.props`** (available in `connect()`)
* To produce the same markup from your own code (e.g. when inserting a component dynamically), use **`Component.toHTML(props)`** — it calls `static template(props)` and attaches `props`, so instances created this way also get `this.props`:

  ```javascript
  this.element.insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend", Slide.toHTML({ text: "A" }));
  ```

* The rendered HTML is sanitized with `dompurify` before being inserted.
* The `<script>` is removed from the DOM once rendered.
* `data-target`, if present, must match an existing element id, otherwise an error is thrown. If **omitted**, the script element itself is the anchor — rendered HTML is inserted at the script's own position (default `beforebegin`, i.e. right where the script sits).
* Insertion uses `targetEl.insertAdjacentHTML(position, html)` where `position` comes from `data-position`. Default: `beforeend` when `data-target` is set, `beforebegin` when it is omitted. Valid values: `beforebegin`, `afterbegin`, `beforeend`, `afterend`.
* Inserted component elements are then auto-initialized like any other DOM addition.

### One Model, many representations: `Model`

The `<script type="application/json">` approach above ties one JSON payload to **one** component. But the same record is often shown several ways on a page — a full card, a compact chip, a row. Returning the JSON once per representation duplicates it.

A **`Model`** is the single source of truth: the server renders the data **once**, Simplicit hydrates it into Model instances, and renders **one component instance per record** into each representation present on the page. Every component is bound 1:1 to its record, so `record.update(...)` re-renders exactly the components bound to that record — and nothing else.

```javascript
import { start, Component, Model } from "simplicit";

// One card per record. `this.model` is the bound record instance.
class ArticleCard extends Component {
  static name = "article-card";
  static template = ({ id, title }) => `
    <div data-component="article-card" data-key="${id}">
      <h4>${title}</h4>
      <form data-ref="rename"><input data-ref="title" value="${title}" /></form>
    </div>`;

  connect() {
    this.on("rename", "submit", (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      this.model.update({ title: this.ref("title").value });
    });
  }
}

// One chip per record — the SAME records, a different view.
class ArticleChip extends Component {
  static name = "article-chip";
  static template = ({ id, title }) =>
    `<li data-component="article-chip" data-key="${id}">${title}</li>`;
}

// A Model "has many" per-record representation components.
class Article extends Model {
  static name = "Article";
  static components = [ArticleCard, ArticleChip];
}

start({ root: document, models: [Article] });
```

```html
<!-- The server returns the data ONCE, as a Model. -->
<script type="application/json" data-model="Article">
  [{ "id": 1, "title": "A" }, { "id": 2, "title": "B" }]
</script>

<!-- Each representation: a container declares which component fills it.
     Simplicit renders one instance per record; data comes from the Model. -->
<div data-container-component="article-card"></div>
<ul data-container-component="article-chip"></ul>
```

Renaming record 1 in its card updates its chip too — both components are bound to the same `Article` instance.

How it works:

1. **Render once.** `<script type="application/json" data-model="<name>">` carries an array of records. At `start()`, Simplicit hydrates them into Model instances (`new Article(record)`) and removes the script.
2. **Declare representations.** A Model lists its per-record components in `static components`. `start({ models })` links each back to its Model (`Component.Model`) and registers it — you don't pass them in `components` yourself. Each `static template` renders **one** record.
3. **Render per record.** Mark a container with `data-container-component="<component-name>"`; Simplicit fills it with one component instance per record. The marker is a plain attribute (not `data-component`), so the foundation ignores the container itself — it's a passive host, not a component. Each rendered element **must** carry `data-key="${record.id}"` — Simplicit uses it to bind the instance to its record (`this.model`) and to keep rows stable across re-renders. A container-filled representation whose template has no `data-key` throws at `start()`. On `Model.add`/`load` the container re-renders — `data-key` keeps existing rows (and their live instances) in place.

#### Collection readouts: a representation without `data-key`

A representation carries `data-key` and stands for **one** record. Declare one **without** a key and it becomes a readout over the **whole collection** — a count, a total, an empty state. Same `static components` list, no container needed: it mounts from plain markup like any component, and its template receives the records as **`records`**.

```javascript
class ArticleTally extends Component {
  static name = "article-tally";
  static template = ({ records }) =>
    `<span data-component="article-tally">${records.length} articles</span>`;
}

class Article extends Model {
  static name = "Article";
  static components = [ArticleCard, ArticleChip, ArticleTally]; // no data-key on the tally
}
```

```html
<span data-component="article-tally"></span>
```

* It is **not** bound to a record, so `this.model` stays `null`; it subscribes to the Model instead and re-renders on **any** change to it — `Model.load`, `Model.add`, `record.del()`, and `record.update(...)`. So a readout that aggregates record *fields* (a sum, "3 unread") stays in step, not just a count of rows.
* `records` is `Model.loaded` — the live array of record instances, **always an array**: `[]` before hydration, and present even on a render you trigger yourself from `connect()`. No default needed in the destructuring.
* It's a plain component root, not a container: put it wherever you want in the markup, and `data-container-component` doesn't apply.
* The subscription is registered as cleanup, so `disconnect()` (element removed from the DOM) unsubscribes it.
* `this.props` still works — `update({ filter: "all" })` merges into `props` and the template receives both `props` and `records`.

#### `Model` API

* **`Model.loaded`** (static getter): the current array of record instances.
* **`Model.byId(id)`**: the record whose `id` matches (string/number coerced), or `null`.
* **`Model.load(items)`**: replace the collection with `new Model(item)` for each item (what hydration calls).
* **`Model.add(attributes)`**: append a record; containers gain a new component per representation.
* **`record.update(partial)`**: mutate one record and re-render the components bound to it, plus any collection readouts. Containers are **not** refilled — the shape didn't change, and the bound components already repainted themselves.
* **`record.del()`**: remove the record from the collection; containers re-render and the components bound to it are removed.

  ```javascript
  Article.byId(1).update({ title: "Renamed" }); // card #1 and chip #1 update; others don't
  ```

* **`this.model`** (on a model-bound component): the single record instance it represents. The `template` receives that record's fields; `this.props` stays as authored.

#### Associations

Models relate to each other by **foreign key**, the same convention Rails uses. Declare the relationship on the Model classes:

```javascript
class Article extends Model {
  static name = "Article";
  static components = [ArticleCard];
}

class Comment extends Model {
  static name = "Comment";
  static components = [CommentItem];
  static belongsTo = [Article]; // Comment holds article_id
}
```

* **`static belongsTo = [Owner, ...]`** — a *belongs to* per owner. Each adds a getter named after the owner, lower-cased (`Article` → `comment.article`). A Model can belong to several owners — `static belongsTo = [Article, Author]` gives both `comment.article` (from `article_id`) and `comment.author` (from `author_id`).
* **`static hasMany = [Child, ...]`** — a *has many* per child. Each adds a getter named after the child, pluralized and lower-cased (`Comment` → `article.comments`).

**Declare `belongsTo` and the `hasMany` inverse is inferred.** `Comment.belongsTo = [Article]` above implies `Article` *has many* `Comment` — you don't write `Article.hasMany = [Comment]` yourself. Declare `static hasMany` explicitly only for a *has many* whose child has no `belongsTo` back-reference.

The **foreign key lives on the "belongs to" side** and is named `<owner>_id` — so a `Comment` that belongs to an `Article` carries `article_id`. Both getters resolve against the live collections at access time:

```javascript
article.comments; // Comment.loaded.filter((c) => c.article_id === article.id)
comment.article;  // Article.byId(comment.article_id)
```

The two collections arrive as **two separate `data-model` scripts**; the foreign key links them:

```html
<script type="application/json" data-model="Article">
  [{ "id": 1, "title": "A" }, { "id": 2, "title": "B" }]
</script>
<script type="application/json" data-model="Comment">
  [{ "id": 1, "article_id": 1, "body": "Nice." },
   { "id": 2, "article_id": 2, "body": "Agreed." }]
</script>
```

##### Nested representations

A `data-container-component` placed **inside** a model-bound component's template renders only *that record's* associated collection, not the whole thing. Simplicit walks up from the container to the nearest component bound to a Model that *has many* of the container's component — and fills it from `owner.<association>` instead of `Child.loaded`:

```javascript
class ArticleCard extends Component {
  static name = "article-card";
  static template = ({ id, title }) => `
    <div data-component="article-card" data-key="${id}">
      <h4>${title}</h4>
      <ul data-container-component="comment-item"></ul>  <!-- this article's comments only -->
    </div>`;
}
```

This is **reactive**: because a nested comment container is still a comment representation, it stays subscribed to `Comment`. `Comment.add({ article_id: 1, ... })` re-renders every comment container on the page — and each one refills from *its* owner, so only article 1's list grows. A top-level `data-container-component="comment-item"` (no model-bound ancestor) still renders the full collection.

#### Streamed-in markup (Turbo)

Model **classes** must be known at `start()` (passed in `models`), but the **markup** need not be present yet. Simplicit keeps watching `root`, so a `data-model` script or a `data-container-component` container injected later — e.g. when [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev) swaps in a server-rendered page — is resolved the same way as at startup:

* A late `data-model` script hydrates its Model (**replacing** the collection) and re-renders every container currently on the page.
* A late container fills in place from whatever records are loaded.
* Order doesn't matter: if containers arrive before their data (or vice-versa), the Model's change notification fills them once both are present.
* Each representation stays subscribed to its Model for the whole session; on a collection change it re-finds its containers in the DOM and re-renders them. A container that's been removed from the page isn't found, so it's never rendered into (no wasted work on elements that are gone); one restored later is found again.

A late `data-model` for a Model you didn't register is **warned** about (`console.warn`) and skipped. It's still a dev error — you likely forgot to pass the Model to `start({ models })` — but a late script is discovered inside a `MutationObserver`, where throwing is uncatchable and would abort the rest of that batch. So the fail-fast **throw** stays on the synchronous `start()` scan; late discoveries warn instead.

**Memory is the source of truth after the initial hydration.** The `data-model` script only *seeds* the Model; it's removed once read. From then on the records live in JS memory (which Turbo keeps across visits), and you mutate them directly — e.g. a websocket pushes a change and you call `Model.byId(id).update(...)`. A *fresh* server visit always returns up-to-date JSON, so seeding from it is correct; the only stale copy is the one frozen inside a **Turbo-cached page snapshot**.

This is why the seed script is **removed** rather than kept: on a **restoration visit** (back/forward) Turbo shows a cached DOM snapshot, and if the stale JSON were still in it, re-hydrating would overwrite your live in-memory changes. With it gone, restoration keeps memory intact — nothing re-hydrates.

Two cases keep the *display* in step with memory:

* **While an instance is mounted**, a live update flows the ordinary way: your websocket handler calls `record.update(...)`, which re-renders every currently-bound instance. Nothing Turbo-specific here.
* **While an instance is unmounted** (you'd navigated away), `record.update(...)` has nothing to re-render — only memory changes. So when that instance re-appears with stale markup (a Turbo restoration shows its cached snapshot), Simplicit re-renders it from its record **as it binds**. *Binding* is the moment Simplicit initializes a rendered element and links it to its record by `data-key` (step 3 above) — it's what sets `this.model`. This is a re-render from memory, not a re-hydration from the (stale) JSON.

#### `start({ ..., models })`

`start()` accepts a `models` array alongside `components`. Model classes and their representation components are resolved at `start()`; you can also register more later with **`addModels(newModels)`** (see [return value](#return-value)) — the mirror of `addComponents`. The DOM markup, either way, can arrive whenever — see above.

## 🕹️ Controllers

Simplicit must have access to all controllers you want to run. In practice, you build a `Controllers` object and pass it to `init()`.

_Example:_

```javascript
// js/index.js (entry point)

import { init } from 'simplicit';

import Admin from "./controllers/Admin.js"; // namespace controller
import User from "./controllers/User.js";   // namespace controller

import Articles from "./controllers/admin/Articles.js";
import Comments from "./controllers/admin/Comments.js";

Object.assign(Admin, {
  Articles,
  Comments
});

const Controllers = {
  Admin,
  User
};

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
  init(Controllers);
});
```

### 💀 Anatomy of the controller

Example controller:

```javascript
// js/controllers/admin/Articles.js

import { helpers } from "simplicit";

import Index from "views/admin/articles/Index.js";
import Show from "views/admin/articles/Show.js";

class Articles {
  // Simplicit supports both static and instance actions
  static index() {
    Index.render();
  }

  show() {
    Show.render({ id: helpers.params.id });
  }
}

export default Articles;
```

Minimal view example (one possible approach):

```javascript
// views/admin/articles/Show.js

export default {
  render: ({ id }) => {
    const el = document.getElementById("app");
    el.textContent = `Article ${id}`;
    // If you need data loading, you can fetch here and update the DOM after.
  },
};
```

### 👷🏻‍♂️ How does it work?

On `DOMContentLoaded`, Simplicit reads these `<body>` attributes:

* `data-namespace` (optional): a namespace path like `Main` or `Main/Panel`
* `data-controller`: controller name (e.g. `Pages`)
* `data-action`: action name (e.g. `index`)

```html
<body data-namespace="Main/Panel" data-controller="Pages" data-action="index">
</body>
```

Then it resolves the matching controller(s), runs lifecycle hooks, and calls the action.

Resolution rules (simplified):

* If `data-namespace` resolves (e.g. `Main/Panel` → `Controllers.Main.Panel`), Simplicit initializes the namespace controller and resolves the page controller under it (e.g. `Controllers.Main.Panel.Pages`).
* Otherwise it skips the namespace controller and falls back to `Controllers.Pages`.

Call order (per controller):

* If a method exists as **static** or **instance**, Simplicit will call it.
* On navigation/re-init, previously active controllers receive `deinitialize()` (if present).

```javascript
namespaceController = new Controllers.Main.Panel;
Controllers.Main.Panel.initialize();               // if exists
namespaceController.initialize();                  // if exists

controller = new Controllers.Main.Panel.Pages;
Controllers.Main.Panel.Pages.initialize();         // if exists
controller.initialize();                           // if exists
Controllers.Main.Panel.Pages.index();              // if exists
controller.index();                                // if exists
```

You don’t need controllers for every page; if a controller/method is missing, Simplicit skips it.

The `init` function returns `{ namespaceController, controller, action }`.

### Ruby on Rails: generating `<body>` data attributes

If you want Rails to generate the controller metadata for Simplicit automatically, you can derive it from `controller_path`, `controller_name`, and `action_name`.

This version supports nested namespaces like `Main/Panel` (any depth):

```ruby
# app/helpers/application_helper.rb

module ApplicationHelper
  def simplicit_body_attrs(default_namespace: nil)
    namespace = controller_path
      .split("/")
      .then { |parts| parts[0...-1] } # everything except the controller name
      .map(&:camelize)
      .join("/")

    # If you want a default namespace (e.g. "Main") for non-namespaced controllers:
    namespace = default_namespace if namespace.blank? && default_namespace

    {
      data: {
        namespace: namespace.presence,           # -> data-namespace="Main/Panel"
        controller: controller_name.camelize,    # -> data-controller="Articles"
        action: action_name,                     # -> data-action="index"
      }.compact,
    }
  end
end
```

```erb
<%= content_tag :body, simplicit_body_attrs(default_namespace: "Main") do %>
  <%= yield %>
<% end %>
```

## 🛠 Helpers

Simplicit exports `helpers` object that has the following properties:
